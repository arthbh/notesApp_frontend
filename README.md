This app has been developed using the MERN stack, which is a combination of four powerful technologies: MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. 

One of the essential features of this Notes App is that it uses password hashing techniques to ensure that users' login credentials are secure. Additionally, the app uses token login to provide a more secure authentication process. This makes the app more secure and ensures that users' information is protected from hackers and other malicious activities.

The app has a beautiful user interface that makes it easy for users to navigate and interact with the application. 

Finally, the app has been deployed on two different platforms. The backend server has been deployed on Cyclic, while the frontend has been deployed on Netlify. This ensures that the app is accessible from anywhere in the world and can handle a large number of concurrent users without any issues.
